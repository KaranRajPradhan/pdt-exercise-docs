# Programming Digital Twins

## Lab Module 03 README.md

Be sure to implement all the requirements listed at [PDT-INF-03-001 - Lab Module 03](https://github.com/programming-digital-twins/pdt-exercise-tasks/issues/11).


### Description

INSTRUCTIONS: Describe, in your own words, the high-level functionality of this lab module by answering the questions listed below.

What does your implementation do? 

The LabBenchStudios-PDT-Unity Library was imported to the BuildingDigitalTwins Unity project as a package and some unmutable prefab components were tested. The Telemetry integration with EDA needs to be done to have data coming into the DTA. Basic scene was created.


How does your implementation work?

For the duration of the course, the library is provided to be able to use some prefabs and integration. We will use these models to efficiently learn the concepts of Digital Twins.


### Design Diagram(s)

INSTRUCTIONS: Include one or more design diagram(s) representing your solution.

### Specific Features

INSTRUCTIONS: List the specific features implemented (or integrated) as part of this lab module. Preface each with either 'EDA' (for the Edge Device App) or 'DTA' (for the Digital Twin App). Keep each feature as concise as possible - e.g., 'EDA: Connects to MQTT broker' or 'DTA: Consumes EDA telemetry via MQTT'.

- DTA: Added basic scene components 
- DTA: Added LabBenchStudios-PDT-Unity package and added a prefab to the scene!
